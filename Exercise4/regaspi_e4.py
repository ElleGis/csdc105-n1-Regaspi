# Description     : This program must read three (3) numbers, comma separated. 
#                   Your program must then check if these numbers are valid 
#                   side lengths of a triangle. If so, your program must compute 
#                   the triangleâ€™s perimeter and area using the functions defined 
#                   in the `geometry` module and display these results. Otherwise, 
#                   your program must issue an error.
# Honor Code      : I have not given nor received any unathorized help in
#                   completing this exercise. I am also well aware of the 
#                   policies stipulated in the AdNU student handbook.
